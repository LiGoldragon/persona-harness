# persona-harness

Typed harness abstraction for Persona.

This crate holds the reusable model for Codex, Claude, Pi, and other
interactive harnesses: identity, lifecycle, transcript events, and adapter
capabilities. Live harness lifecycle and transcript counters are owned by a
Kameo `HarnessActor` so assembled runtimes can push state changes through a
mailbox instead of sharing loose mutable objects.
