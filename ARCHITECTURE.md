# persona-harness — architecture

*Harness identity, lifecycle, transcript, and adapter contracts.*

`persona-harness` models interactive AI harnesses as addressable runtime
objects. Codex, Claude, and Pi are closed schema variants; later production
harnesses become explicit variants, not `Other { name }` string payloads.
Harnesses carry lifecycle state, typed transcript observations, sequence
pointers, and delivery capabilities. The Persona-facing terminal contract is
`signal-persona-terminal`; terminal transport execution is delegated to
`persona-terminal`.

> **Scope.** Any "sema" reference here means today's `sema` library
> (rename pending → `sema-db`). The eventual `Sema` is broader;
> today's persona-harness is a realization step. See
> `~/primary/ESSENCE.md` §"Today and eventually".

## 0 · TL;DR

This repo owns the harness abstraction. It does not own routing policy,
OS-specific focus observation, or terminal durable PTY transport.

## 1 · Component Surface

`persona-harness` exposes:

- harness identity records;
- lifecycle state;
- transcript events;
- adapter capability records;
- terminal delivery adapter records;
- a Kameo harness actor surface for the assembled runtime;
- test fixtures for fake harnesses.

## 2 · State and Ownership

The harness component owns live harness identity and lifecycle state.
Transcript and lifecycle events are typed observations. Normal fanout carries
typed observations plus sequence pointers, not broad raw transcript bytes.
`Harness` is the mailbox-backed owner for one live harness binding, its
lifecycle state, and its transcript event count.

Harness identity views are read-path projections: `Full`, `Redacted`, or
`Hidden`. The current code names the local view selector
`HarnessIdentityView`. It is not an authorization gate. Designer/127 keeps
raw transcript access behind explicit later range queries and closes
`HarnessKind`; designer/125 puts runtime permission in filesystem ACLs plus
router channel state choreographed by mind.

When durable harness history is needed, the harness actor opens its **own**
redb file (e.g. `harness.redb`) through a harness-owned Sema layer over the
workspace's `sema` database library. The harness actor sequences its own
writes; no shared cross-component database. Per
`~/primary/reports/designer/92-sema-as-database-library-architecture-revamp.md`.

## 3 · Boundaries

This repo owns:

- harness domain types;
- read-path harness identity projections;
- harness actor lifecycle;
- transcript event shape;
- adapter contracts.
- harness-owned terminal delivery adaptation.

This repo does not own:

- routing decisions (`persona-router`);
- OS/window focus backend (`persona-system`);
- PTY byte transport (`persona-terminal`);
- harness wire contract definitions (`signal-persona-harness`);
- terminal wire contract definitions (`signal-persona-terminal`);
- the top-level engine-manager contract (`signal-persona`);
- database write ownership for other components' Sema layers.

## 4 · Invariants

- Harnesses are first-class records.
- Harness identity has an explicit visibility axis; redaction is typed, not a
  string filter.
- A closed viewer does not imply a killed harness.
- Transcript and lifecycle observations are pushed events.
- Live harness lifecycle and transcript state belongs inside Kameo actors.
- Adapter capabilities are explicit typed records, not stringly flags.

## Constraint Tests

| Constraint | Test |
|---|---|
| Harness identity projection keeps full, redacted, and hidden views distinct. | `nix flake check .#harness-identity-projection-views` |
| Harness identity projection cannot collapse back to one always-full record. | `nix flake check .#harness-identity-projection-source-constraint` |
